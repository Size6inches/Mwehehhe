My Dearest Love, My Forever Langga,

Happy 7th Monthsary, my love. As I write this, I feel both nervous and excited because no matter how many words I try to gather, they will always feel too small to hold the weight of what I truly feel for you. But still, I want to try, because you deserve every assurance, every promise, every confession of love that my heart holds.

Seven months, bby. Seven months of waking up each day knowing that I have someone like you in my life. Seven months of smiles, late-night talks, small fights, laughter, sweet moments, and countless little things that make me fall for you over and over again. Seven months of realizing again and again that it‚Äôs always you and ikaw ra gyud.

I look back and remember how it all started. How in Grade 7, I would steal glances, how I carried silent admiration, how I didn‚Äôt even imagine that someday, you would be mine. Yet here we are, my love in a place where my younger self would‚Äôve only dreamed of. Sometimes I laugh at myself, thinking, unsaon nalang if wala ko ni-try, if wala ko nagpadayon? Because if I didn‚Äôt, I wouldn‚Äôt have found this kind of love that gives me peace, joy, and strength all at once.

Everyday with you is a gentle reminder of why love is worth waiting for. There are days nga dili perfect, times when misunderstandings come, times when I go quiet instead of explaining. I know I have my flaws, langga, and I am not blind to them. But what matters is I am learning and I am growing because of you. Because I want to become better for you, not just for myself. Kay unsaon man, ikaw akong forever, and if I want to spend a lifetime with you, then I must also learn how to love you not just with passion but with patience, not just with feelings but with understanding.

There are moments when you overthink, when you doubt yourself, when you worry too much about how others see you. I know that. And every single time, I just want to hold your face, look into your eyes, and say, langga, please remember: you are enough, you are worthy, and you are loved. You don‚Äôt need to be anyone else, because you as you are is already everything I‚Äôve ever prayed for.

Do you know what you are to me? You are my home. The safe place where I can rest my tired heart. The one voice that can calm the loud storms in my head. The smile that makes even the darkest days lighter. The hand that I want to hold for the rest of my life. You are not just part of my life, langga ans you are my life.

Sometimes I think about the future and imagine us years from now. Maybe we‚Äôll be living in our own place, waking up beside each other, starting mornings with laughter and coffee. Maybe we‚Äôll be traveling together, holding hands while exploring the world. Or maybe just simple moments siguro like cooking together, watching movies, or falling asleep on the couch. No matter what the picture looks like, one thing stays the same: it‚Äôs you beside me. Always you.

And if ever storms come - because they will, love is not always smooth but bbyy I promise you this: I will never walk away. I won‚Äôt give up just because it gets hard. I will choose you again and again, in every argument, in every silence, in every test of patience. Dili ko mo surrender sa imoha, because you are worth every effort, every sacrifice, every fight we have to go through.

Langga, I know I can get intense sometimes with how much I love you. There are days when I feel like my chest could burst just thinking about how much I want to protect you, how much I want to make you happy. And sometimes I worry nga maybe I love too much. But then I realize, loving you too much is not possible, because my heart was created to love you exactly like this endlessly, deeply, passionately.

Thank you, my love. Thank you for being you. For being sweet, caring, understanding, and even stubborn at times but because all of it makes you, you. Thank you for loving me despite my imperfections, for staying even when I mess up, for choosing me every single day. I will never take that for granted.

Seven months may be short compared to forever, but it already feels like a lifetime of reasons why I know you‚Äôre the one. And as we step into another month, another chapter, I want to promise you again: I will stay. I will love you. I will protect your heart. I will grow with you. I will dream with you. And I will hold your hand through every season of our lives.

Ikaw ra gyud akong gusto. Wala na‚Äôy lain. You are my always, my today, my tomorrow, my forever.

Happy 7th Monthsary, langga. Here‚Äôs to more months, more years, more lifetimes with you. I love you so, so much more more than words will ever capture, more than distance can weaken, more than time can measure.

Forever yours,
Imong bbyyy
